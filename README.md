# [EXPERIMENT] Black Duck Scan Action
A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for launching a Black Duck scan as part of a GitHub CI/CD workflow, offering a number of workflow use cases:
- Break the build if a security policy is not met
- Run fast, incremental scans on a pull request, only reporting newly introduced components
- Leave comments on a pull request that identify vulnerable components and offer upgrade guidance
- Import Black Duck vulnerabilities as code scanning alerts via SARIF
- Open a fix pull request for vulnerable components with an available upgrade

This script is provided under an OSS license (specified in the LICENSE file) and has been developed by Synopsys field engineers as a contribution to the Synopsys user community. Please direct questions and comments to the [Black Duck Integrations Forum](https://community.synopsys.com/s/topic/0TO34000000gGZnGAM/black-duck-integrations) in the Synopsys user community.

The following technology stacks are currently supported:
- Javascript.Node.js/NPM
- Java/Maven
- .NET/NuGet (in progress)

## Usage

The action runs as a Docker container, supporting GitHub-hosted and Self-hosted Linux runners. You can use the Action as follows:

```yaml
name: Scan a project with Black Duck

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
  workflow_dispatch:

    # This will run a "full" or "intelligent" scan, logging new components in the Black Duck Hub server
    # in order to provide real time notifications when new vulnerabilities are reported.

## Inputs

The Black Duck Scanning action has a number of input parameters that can be passed using `with`. All input parameters have default vaules that should ensure reasonable default behavior.

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mode | intelligent | Run either an intelligent scan (comprehensive, and update central database with component versions) or rapid scan (runs in seconds, ephemeral)|
| sarif | blackduck-sarif.json | Output results in SARIF file suitable for import into GitHub |
| comment_on_pr | false | If running triggered by a pull request, leave a comment on the pull request with the reported issues |
| fix_pr | false | Generate a fix pull request if a vulnerable componenent has an available upgrade path |
| upgrade_major | false | Include upgrades that are beyond the current major version of the component being used - note, this can introduce a breaking change if the component's APIs are sufficiently different |
| incremental_results | false | Filter the output to only report on newly introduced components. Do not report on any vulnerabilities on component versions previously detected in the project |
